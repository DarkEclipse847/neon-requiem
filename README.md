Oddysey for love and purpouse
## Isometric Quest using Bevy 0.11

This is a simple visual novel(quest) about finding purpouse in life. This is a story about a musician who is fighting with depression and existencial crysis.

### Tasks:
- [ ] Need to implement 3d(fake2d) walls
    - [ ] draw a texture for 3d mesh
- [ ] Create a camera movement
    - [ ] move the camera up
- [ ] Implement dynamic lightning
    - [ ] add lightsourses
    - [ ] add glowing characters(so they can be visible in the dark)
    - [ ] add glowing blocks
- [x] ~~Fix movement animation~~
    - ~~animation behaving weirdly after adding face_camera fn so it needs to be fixed~~
### Thoughts:
- Overlapping floor textures actually looks really cool, i need to run tests on other devices later, maybe i'll add thisartifacts as a feature

- Use bevy-vfx-bug plugin to complete trippy scene in the future
    - chromatic abberation could come in handy for replecating visual glitches
